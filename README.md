Continuum Design -- version 3.0 -- now with old skool static site HTML, CSS, &amp; JS

## Gulp Workflow
In an attempt to better keep up with current technology and build techniques, I am moving from a Grunt to Gulp workflow.

Additionally, I am going to switch from Require.js to Browserify or Webpack for my Javascript dependency management.

## Accessibility
This site serves two purposes. The first is to highlight my skills. The second is to showcase accessible design of
Javascript-centric web pages. I am a firm believer in progressive enhancement, and access for all.
